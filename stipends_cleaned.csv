Living in Boston on ~30k/yr has been tight enough that I usually have to dip into savings to meet my monthly financial obligations. I am lucky enough to have that financial buffer so things are still working out for me without loans, but it's a pretty privileged position to be in. BC has given grad students a cost of living adjustment starting Fall 2023, so I should be making ~40k/yr moving forward. Looking forward to getting a nice pair of glasses when the first paycheck hits. :)","ph.d. in mesa"

Fees used to include $3200 for healthcare but the university started covering that last semester! Big win for the student group that's been pushing for stipend increases as well - my stipend is much higher than those of many other departments.
 Rent prices have skyrocketed since I started my PhD, and my partner's student visa expired so she had to leave the country halfway through our lease, so now I'm paying about half my stipend in rent and utilities, and the rest dries up pretty quick between groceries, healthcare, and sending money to my partner since her parents aren't paid enough to fully cover her needs in her home country while she finds work.

Note that the cost of living on the Long Island is extremely high though this is a suburban area. Monthly rents of serviced apartments vary from $800~$1000 (living room), $1200 (a non-master bedroom in a 3b2b unit) to $2000~$3000+ (studio/1b1b fully private apt). Thus, most of us PhD students are forced to rent bedrooms in a house owned by private landlords and share one kitchen/fridge by 5+ people.","computer science"

Everybody is, and most are also pushing into the 60hrs/week range as well. Fine, it's research, we love it, it's not about the hours. And it's mostly fine during the semester when you have a couple of classes taking up ~10 hours during the week. However, during the summer, when you're taking no classes you're still there for 40 hrs and only getting paid for 20. In reality, you're getting paid ~$12.50 an hour (or worse if you're there for even more hours).  It feels strange and dishonest when I fill out payroll sheets that only show 1/2 the time I'm working. In any other job, this would be called wage theft, but since its in academia, it's considered research experience...

Hosing in Santa Cruz is ridiculous. My single room in a shared 6-bed/2-bath house costs just over $1000/month, and I count myself lucky. Most grad students are spending over 50 or 60% of income on rent.

My offer only guarantees 3 years of funding, with years 2 and 3 coming from TA-ships. Though it sounds like students are generally okay finding funding through a mix of psych TA-ships, TA-ships in other departments, grants/fellowships, or various intern positions with campus departments.

TA rates are set by a UC-wide union contract, and there's an active campaign on the UCSC campus this year to get a cost of living adjustment to address the local cost of housing.","psychology"

Many outside fellowships we win count against stipend funds (excepting those for specifics like research travel). Given Boston's high cost of living and my student loan payments from undergrad, I often end up relying on a credit line between paydays.","history"

Summer funding is NOT guaranteed. Only those who've passed their comps are eligible to teach and it depends on if you will be available and able to do it. Usually 3rd years on up are the ones doing it. There's rumblings eventually the college will make summer funding guaranteed but they are extremely slow so don't count on it. It's $6k per summer semester and there's two summer semesters. I haven't heard of anyone teaching both summer semesters (usually you're off doing research.) So summer is starving time generally if you haven't lined up work or doing research by this point.

It's a great department, hampered by terrible high university administration who should be all fired.","history"

I have a small additional yearly scholarship of $2,500. I bet maybe one-third to one-half of the graduate students in my department have a small additional scholarship like this, usually between $2,500 and $5,000.

You are expected to serve as a teaching assistant for one year and a co-instructor of record for one semesterneither of these roles increase the stipend.

I did not include in my pay calculation the part-time job on campus that I have. Emory allows graduate students to perform 10 hours of outside work per week. I haven't regularly had a part-time job during graduate school, but if I did, it would give me an extra $5,000 per year. Maybe one-third of the students do part-time work at any given time.

Atlanta in general has a low cost of living, though it has begun to rise in recent years. Finding an affordable, non-shitty apartment within a reasonable distance of campus can be difficult, but overall I feel like I can afford the necessities as well as a few frivolities.

A very important note: starting in the academic year 2019-2020, the Laney Graduate School at Emory will set the minimum base stipend of all of their programs at $31,000. Some of the STEM disciplines were already around this salary, but it feels historic to me for graduate students in humanities disciplines like mine to be paid that high. For some context, according to an online city-to-city cost-of-living calculator, students in Boston would need $44,800 for the same purchasing power as $31,000 in Atlanta; students in Chicago would need $36,100, Berkeley, $45,600, Brooklyn, $53,700.","history"

It went down about $5000 total between years 1 and 2, which made it hard to budget. Additionally, as a marine biologist, summer is the busiest (=most expensive) time for collecting data, and I'm skidding into Fall quarter with almost nothing in checking or savings, even while splitting costs with my partner. Santa Cruz is nightmarishly expensive as a grad student-- I paid over $1000 a month in rent and utilities to live in a semi-renovated garage (read: still had an uninsulated garage door) for two years. I have moved in with my boyfriend about 13 miles away from the office. This has blown up my gas usage, but saves me about $400/mo. I am seriously considering starting a side gig to supplement my income when I have to start TAing next year, because I'm now 30 and would like to get married and start a family in the next few years.

Technically, we are paid the same amount, but we receive less of our stipend during the summer. This is because of a FICA tax deduction for which we are eligible only if registered for 6+ credits. We qualify for this deduction during the rest of the year, but since we are not registered in classes during the summer sessions, we don't qualify. This despite the fact that we do at least as much research during summer as any other time. It seems an easy solution if our department offered the graduate research class during the summer sessions. We could all register for 6 or more credits and be fine. I don't think the change would require students or PIs to go out of their way much at all; I imagine it would just be a question of some administrative coordination.","biology"

For each class (stand alone) taught, PhD student receives 2 teaching points. We need 5 teaching points (2x stand alone teaching and 1x TA'ing, or 5x TA'ing a class) before graduation. For teaching a stand alone course, students gets 'paid' $6000. But this is already included in the stipend. If student cannot find TA or teaching position, they will receive a lower stipend than the $25000 promised.
The required fees are the quarterly Student Life Fee. If you do not take classes in the summer, you pay $380 less than the $1520 stated. In exchange for the Student Life Fee, you get free access to general physician, as well as events (social events, yoga classes, mental health activities etc). 
Rent in Hyde Park area is around $1100-1600 for a one-bed room apartment, less for a studio or room in shared apartment. 
The University also pays for the PhD student's health insurance (United Healthcare) which covers a lot. The Out of Pocket is $500, and co-pay of 10% goes until another $1000. So if you have medical costs above $1500 everything is paid for.

For humanities students, there are limited resources for funds for conference travels etc. Costs outside of rent/gas/phone bills/groceries need some managing, but everything depends on the rent situation. Many graduate students live in shared housing, and can thus afford a conference every once in a while.

Many students in the humanities have some sort of student job, e.g. working at publications office, helping professors with databases, publications,  working at the language center, UChicago Grad etc. These often pay around $15/hour, but it can also be less. 

PhD-students with families can get $2000 extra a year from the University. This is officially for child care, but can be spend any way you want. This does not cover child care premiums (ca. $1100-1800 a month per child in the area, depending on the facility).

Summer salaries are not guaranteed. There is no extra income for teaching as a graduate student. Students are expected to pay student fees without help from advisers or department. Classes for the first year are full time and with the new deadline system, you will not be able to find a second job that doesn't leave you working for nearly 24 / 7 (also, I'm not sure you want to work nights in Atlanta. It's not a safe city). With my salary and qualifying for FDIC low income housing, walking to school every day and cutting back where I can, I am still not able to afford basic groceries on my salary. Many graduate students in the department are really struggling to get by.
